{"name":"adamhelsinger_cancer-rates-by-u-s-state","title":"Cancer Rates by U.S. State","description":"The rates are the numbers out of 100,000 people who developed or died from cancer each year.\n\nIn the following maps, the U.S. states are divided into groups based on the rates at which people developed or died from cancer in 2013, the most recent year for which incidence data are available. \n\nThe rates are the numbers out of 100,000 people who developed or died from cancer each year.\n\n**Incidence Rates by State**\n*The number of people who get cancer is called cancer incidence. In the United States, the rate of getting cancer varies from state to state.*\n\n* *Rates are per 100,000 and are age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population.\n\n* ‡Rates are not shown if the state did not meet USCS publication criteria or if the state did not submit data to CDC.\n\n* †Source: U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group.
