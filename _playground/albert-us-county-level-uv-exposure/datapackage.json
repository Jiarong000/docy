Exposures in early childhood may be most important and there is evidence that cumulative UV exposure and the time spent outdoors may increase melanoma risk. The following dataset has been developed in response to a need for an objective metric of individual UV exposure for which the accuracy of exposure estimates is known.  \n\nData:\n[UV Data - Counties (XLSX - 143KB)](https://gis.cancer.gov/tools/uv-exposure/uv-county.xlsx)  \n\nPeer Reviewed Publication Describing the Methodology behind the UV Exposure Dataset:\nA Comparison of Thiessen Polygon, Kriging, and Spline Models of Potential UV Exposure external link.
