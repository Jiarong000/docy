{"name":"dartmouthatlas_cancer-patients-death","title":"Cancer Patients Death","description":"Cancer patients Deaths occurring in 2003 to 2012\n\n#Introduction\nMore than 1.5 million cancers are diagnosed each year in the United States. This Dartmouth Atlas report examines how elderly patients with poor prognosis cancer are cared for across regions and hospitals and finds remarkable variation depending on where the patients live and receive care. Even among the nation‰Ûªs leading medical centers, there is no consistent pattern of care or evidence that treatment patterns follow patient preferences. Rather, the report demonstrates that many hospitals and physicians aggressively treat patients with curative attempts they may not want, at the expense of improving the quality of their last weeks and months. \n\nMore information about the 2003 - 2007 data can be found in [Quality of End-of-Life Cancer Care for Medicare Beneficiaries.](http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/downloads/reports/Cancer_report_11_16_10.pdf)\n\n# Terms and Conditions\nThe data set forth at http://www.data.world/dartmouthatlas was obtained from The Dartmouth Atlas, which is funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Dartmouth Clinical and Translational Science Institute, under award number UL1TR001086 from the National Center for
